This is the github repository for the chess engine, JuulesPlusPlus. This is a passion project of mine that I created with the goal of making an engine that could reliably beat me in the game of chess. It certainly can, primarily because of its relatively high calculation speed. Where it currently lacks precision is in the endgame, where some key concepts are missing.

JuulesPlusPlus supports Universal Chess Interface (UCI) integration, so I made it into a [Lichess bot](https://lichess.org/@/JuulesPlusPlus)! The bot will in all likeliness be offline since I have to run the bot locally. If you want a quick game, you can instead check out the [demo page](https://juules32.github.io/juules-plus-plus/)!

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Juules32/juules-plus-plus/wiki) for information about how to run and use the engine, among other things.

### Special Thanks
I want to shout out the amazing [Code Monkey King](https://github.com/maksimKorzh), whose [series on bitboard chess engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUNP-UjujBM&list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs) was immensely useful for the development of this project. Please do check out and support his work!
